  [ Naparuba ]
  * Fix : (reported by : DGuenault) hack_poller_tag_by_macros was not applying poller_tag to commands, only root objects, but after the command tag inheritance, so the checks were not taggued.
  * Fix : test_timeout was still using a Manager and not a Queue now.
  * Add : helper class for parsing perfdata metrics.
  * Add : PerfDatas parser class that is the upper level of Metric.
  * Fix : UI page navigation should not propose page too high if not need.
  * Add : first attempt of a perfometer backend. It's more a poc than a prodcode in fact, should put all of this in modules with a good and simple API.
  * Enh : the Service-perfdata module now open/close the perfdata file each second. So it's compatible with tools like Centreon that move it (and so the module can't keep a file desc on it)
  * * Fix : memcache and redis retention modules. They were loading notifications->contacts->commands but this class got slots but no __getstate__, so it was a real problem.
  * Fix: jenkins is not happy with utf8 print...
  * Enh : when there is a dispatching problem, the arbiter send and send again the same configuration to satellites. Now it will bypass the resend of the same conf. Less verbose too.
